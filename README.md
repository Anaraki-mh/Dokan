# Dokan
**Dokan** is an **E-commerce** solution made for small and medium size businesses to provide an online platform to sell their products directly to the customers. 

Dokan provides the user with an easy-to-use yet very powerful **management dashboard** to manage  **Products**, **Product Categories**, **Blog posts**, **Blog Categories**, **Comments** on Products and Blog posts, **Menus**, **UI elements** and Info, **Tax Categories**, **Discounts** and **Coupons**, **Orders** and Stocks and more!

The application manages and saves customers' carts in the backend and database; therefore if a user doesn't complete/pay for an order, it will stay saved in the database for the next visits. Once a user is ready to pay for items in the cart, **Stripe** is used to process the payment and make sure the payment has gone through. But if the customer, for any reason, decides to ask for a **refund** before the package is shipped, the refund process if **fully automated** and managed in the **management dashboard** of Dokan.
